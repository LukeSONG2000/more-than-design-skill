# Liquid Glass Controls

Use this reference when a task asks for Liquid Glass-style controls, glass buttons, floating toolbars, segmented controls, toggles, sliders, search fields, badges, status chips, contextual menus, or action palettes. Read `liquid-glass-adoption.md` first for adoption boundaries and Landmarks sample routing, then use this file for concrete control design decisions. For API examples, motion/transition code, color/Dark Mode variants, and UIKit/AppKit/Web fallbacks, also read `liquid-glass-api-motion-color.md`. For HIG/API linked-page routing, read `liquid-glass-deep-link-map.md`.

## Design intent

Liquid Glass controls sit in the top functional layer of an interface. They should make actions easier to find while letting content remain the visual focus.

- Use glass for controls that float over rich content, control navigation, trigger contextual actions, or show compact status.
- Avoid glass for dense form fields, long text containers, data tables, destructive confirmations, or any element that needs maximum contrast.
- Prefer native/platform controls when available; custom glass controls are for high-value moments and need accessibility fallbacks.
- Keep glass groups sparse. One well-placed glass action cluster is stronger than many competing translucent controls.
- Motion must explain state, grouping, or continuity; do not animate glass just because it can shimmer.

## Native vs custom UIKit controls

On iOS/iPadOS 26+, separate system-owned Liquid Glass from app-owned custom glass:

| Component | Preferred route | Do not replace with |
|---|---|---|
| Top-level task/file/skill tab bar | `UITabBar` + `UITabBarItem` | Three custom `UIGlassEffect` buttons or hand-authored selected backgrounds |
| Local mode segmented control | `UISegmentedControl` | Custom selected platter, custom blur/refraction, or hand-authored spring when native iOS 26 control is available |
| Add button that opens actions | `UIButtonConfiguration.glassButtonConfiguration` + `UIMenu` | Custom spring/blur menu morph |
| Title or picker that opens a menu | `UIButtonConfiguration.plainButtonConfiguration` + custom collapsed title layout + `UIMenu` | Visible fake glass capsule when the collapsed state should be transparent |
| Search/refresh/input/composite controls | `UIGlassEffect` inside `UIVisualEffectView` | Standard tab/segment/menu/navigation components |
| Android, Web, or iOS 25 and below | `BlurView`, CSS, `UIBlurEffect`, or opaque fallback | Claims of exact native Liquid Glass parity |

Rule: use `UIGlassEffect` for custom glass containers, not to explain or rebuild standard UIKit components like `UITabBar` or `UISegmentedControl`. For standard controls, let UIKit own material, hit testing, accessibility, selected states, and transition behavior.

## HIG Materials control rules

### Functional layer first

Liquid Glass controls belong in the functional layer above content. Use them for navigation controls, toolbar actions, floating media controls, inspectors, contextual actions, status chips, and direct-manipulation controls. Do not turn content cards, app backgrounds, long text panels, or dense form regions into Liquid Glass just for style.

A content-layer exception exists for controls that become transiently interactive. Sliders and toggles can take on a Liquid Glass appearance during activation because the material highlights direct manipulation. In Web/client implementations, translate this as a stronger active thumb/track or switch thumb treatment, not as a permanently glassy form row.

### Regular and clear selection

| Control context | Prefer | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Text-heavy popover, alert, sidebar, inspector | Regular | Background blur/luminosity adjustment protects labels and icons |
| Toolbar/tab bar over unpredictable app content | Regular or opaque fallback | Legibility matters more than immersion |
| Media controls over photo/video | Clear, with contrast check | Rich content should remain visible |
| Bright media behind controls | Clear plus dark dimming layer | Apple's clear-glass guidance uses dimming to preserve legibility |
| Dark media or native media controls | Clear may not need extra dimming | Existing darkness or native control treatment can provide contrast |
| Dense data, forms, tables | Standard material or solid surface | Liquid Glass adds noise and harms scan speed |

### Color placement

- Default glass should inherit from the content behind it rather than introduce brand color everywhere.
- Use colored glass for a single primary action, prominent status, or high-value emphasis.
- For primary actions, tint the glass background; do not rely on colored icon/text alone.
- Avoid coloring every toolbar item. Multiple tinted glass controls dilute hierarchy and can hurt readability.
- On colorful backgrounds, keep toolbar/tab labels monochrome unless the accent color is clearly distinct.
- Check both resting and scrolled states so content colors do not collide with control colors.


## Control anatomy

A Liquid Glass-inspired control has five layers:

| Layer | Role | Frontend translation |
|---|---|---|
| Backdrop sample | Connects control to content behind it | blur, saturation, tint, optional edge reflection |
| Material body | Defines tappable/control surface | translucent fill, border highlight, inner glow |
| Elevation ring | Separates the control from busy content | soft shadow plus subtle top/edge stroke |
| Content | Label, icon, value, or status | semantic color, high contrast, no low-opacity text |
| State overlay | Press, hover, focus, selected, disabled | opacity, scale, ring, tint, or grouped morph |

Minimum requirements:

- The content layer must stay readable without blur.
- Keyboard focus must be visible even when the glass surface is subtle.
- Reduced transparency must produce an opaque surface.
- Reduced motion must replace morph/slide/parallax with opacity or instant state changes.

## Material tokens

These are cross-platform starting points, not Apple API values. Treat `regular` as the default readable material and `clear` as a special media/rich-background variant.

| Token | Default | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `--glass-fill` | `rgba(255,255,255,.62)` | Increase opacity over busy backgrounds |
| `--glass-fill-dark` | `rgba(28,28,30,.58)` | Use dark semantic surface, not pure black |
| `--glass-blur` | `18px` | 12-24px is usually enough for controls |
| `--glass-saturate` | `1.4` | Lower if colors become noisy |
| `--glass-stroke` | `rgba(255,255,255,.42)` | Pair with darker bottom border if needed |
| `--glass-shadow` | `0 18px 48px rgba(0,0,0,.18)` | Reduce for small inline controls |
| `--glass-radius-sm` | `12px` | Small icon/action buttons |
| `--glass-radius-md` | `18px` | Segmented/action groups |
| `--glass-radius-lg` | `26px` | Floating palettes / badges cluster |
| `--glass-radius-pill` | `999px` | Pills, search, compact status |

Token rules:

- Use semantic text tokens from `../../web/apple-style-tokens.md`; do not make labels translucent to imply glass.
- Use radius hierarchy from the container inward. Nested controls should feel concentric.
- If blur is unavailable, keep the same radius and spacing but use a solid semantic surface.
- The blur layer is performance-sensitive; keep animated properties to opacity and transform where possible.

## State model

| State | Visual behavior | Motion behavior | Accessibility note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rest | Clear material, low shadow, readable label | none | Contrast passes without hover |
| Hover | Slight lift or highlight | 80-140ms ease-out | Do not rely on hover on touch |
| Press | Compress 1-2%, highlight dims or tightens | 50-100ms ease-out | Action should not wait for animation end |
| Focus | Strong ring outside glass edge | immediate or 80ms fade | Ring must be visible on busy content |
| Selected | Stronger fill/tint, selected indicator or thumb | 150-250ms glide/morph | Selected state must not be color-only |
| Disabled | More opaque, lower content contrast but still legible | none | Avoid transparent disabled controls over content |
| Loading | Replace content with progress or optimistic state | progress morph or subtle fade | Respect pause/stop/reduced motion |
| Error | Solid semantic error surface or message below | short nudge only if useful | Error text and icon required |

## Control recipes

### 1. Glass button

Use for primary or contextual actions over media/content.

Structure:

- pill or rounded-rectangle surface
- icon optional; text required unless the icon is universally understood
- minimum 44px touch target on mobile, 32px compact desktop target only for dense toolbars
- one primary glass button per local region

Behavior:

- rest surface is translucent but label is opaque
- press compresses slightly and reduces shadow
- focus ring appears outside the material, not inside the blur
- prominent variant uses a stronger fill or semantic tint, not excessive glow

Avoid:

- destructive action as clear glass only
- text-only glass button on busy imagery
- multiple primary glass buttons in one cluster

### 2. Icon button

Use for toolbar items, floating media controls, map controls, and compact inspectors.

Structure:

- square or circular hit target with icon centered optically
- optional label for visible text on desktop; always provide accessible label
- selected/favorite state uses filled icon plus surface change

Behavior:

- hover lift is tiny; press is immediate
- icon should not swim or parallax separately from the button
- selected state can tint the icon, but shape/fill must also change

Avoid:

- unlabeled custom icons
- icon-only groups where each icon has a different visual language
- mixing icon-only and text buttons inside the same glass capsule without a clear reason

### 3. Glass button group / toolbar cluster

Use for related actions in a toolbar or floating action palette.

Structure:

- group related actions in shared capsules
- separate unrelated groups with fixed gaps
- keep group width as small as functionally possible
- align clusters with platform expectations: bottom on phone when thumb reach matters, top/trailing on tablet/desktop when paired with content tools

Behavior:

- material can respond to scroll threshold, but individual controls should remain spatially stable
- use group-level hover/focus only for palettes; individual focus remains visible
- hidden actions remove the whole toolbar item, not only inner content

Cross-platform translation:

- Web toolbar: grouped rounded surfaces with fixed gaps and a solid fallback
- Desktop client: lower blur, stronger border, more compact density
- Mobile app: larger hit targets, fewer groups, avoid placing under system gestures

### 4. Segmented control

Use for local mode switching, filters, view mode changes, and short mutually exclusive choices.

Native iOS/iPadOS 26 route:

- Use `UISegmentedControl` for two-to-five related choices such as `Installed` / `Store`.
- Configure semantic state through `selectedSegmentIndex`; handle changes with `UIControlEventValueChanged`.
- Keep `momentary = NO` for persistent local mode selection. Use momentary behavior only when segments perform actions without a retained selected state.
- Use equal-width segments when labels are similar; `apportionsSegmentWidthsByContent = NO` is appropriate for balanced two-option controls.
- Do not set custom selected backgrounds, shadows, blur, refraction, or animation parameters when the native iOS 26 control is active. UIKit owns the Liquid Glass track, floating selector, press feedback, and switching animation.
- `selectedSegmentTintColor`, title attributes, segment widths, content offsets, and overall frame are app-controlled API surfaces. The internal selected platter size, glass intensity, shadow elevation, edge relief, and system animation curve are not independently adjustable; switch to a custom fallback only when those internals must be art-directed.

Structure:

- one shared glass track
- selected segment has a stronger pill/thumb or fill
- labels should be short; icons optional but not required

Behavior:

- on native iOS/iPadOS 26, let UIKit animate selected changes
- on Web, Android, iOS 25 and below, or manual fallback, selected thumb can glide 150-250ms using transform
- content switches with crossfade or fast slide, not with large page movement
- selected state must include text/shape change, not color alone

Avoid:

- more than 5 segments
- using segmented control as global navigation
- describing native `UISegmentedControl` as a `UIGlassEffect` implementation
- glass over high-frequency table filters where a solid chip group is clearer

### 5. Toggle / switch

Use for binary settings and feature enablement.

Structure:

- track can be glass; thumb should remain solid enough to read state
- on/off state uses thumb position plus color/label/icon
- label sits outside the switch for readability

Behavior:

- thumb glide 150-220ms
- press target includes label where platform allows
- avoid morphing the whole switch into a different shape; state clarity matters more than spectacle

Avoid:

- tiny glass switch over photo/video
- using blur to indicate disabled state
- relying on green alone for on state

### 6. Slider

Use for continuous values such as media, brightness-like settings, map zoom, or creative controls.

Structure:

- track can be translucent, but filled progress and thumb need strong contrast
- value label or preview appears near the thumb only when helpful
- large values need precise keyboard/pointer support

Behavior:

- thumb can become more glass-like during drag, but should not obscure the value
- track fill updates immediately
- haptic-like visual feedback should be subtle and tied to meaningful stops

Avoid:

- low-contrast track over busy content
- animated blur on every pointer move
- hiding exact value when precision matters

### 7. Search field

Use when search is primary or global.

Structure:

- pill-shaped field with solid text and clear placeholder
- search icon, clear button, and optional scope chips
- on phone, respect keyboard movement and bottom placement when platform convention requires it

Behavior:

- expansion should be anchored to its starting position
- search results crossfade; avoid moving the field unpredictably
- if search is a tab, use a semantic search tab model rather than a generic tab with search icon

Avoid:

- glass placeholder that fails contrast
- large blur field over text-heavy content
- global search hidden inside a decorative glass capsule

### 8. Floating status chip / badge

Use for compact status, earned badge, ongoing task, sync state, or notification count.

Structure:

- small glass or solid badge surface with icon plus value/label
- if it is actionable, make the hit target larger than the visible chip
- status color uses semantic meaning, not decoration

Behavior:

- status updates can use numeric tick, fade, or small morph
- related badge plus toggle can be placed in one material group
- collapse/expand should preserve source/destination relationship

Avoid:

- badge cluster covering primary content
- auto-playing badge animations without user action
- using Apple-only system capsule shapes for unrelated platforms

### 9. Popover / menu trigger

Use when a button opens a menu, picker, or inspector.

Structure:

- trigger and popover should feel materially related
- popover arrow/anchor points to the source control where platform supports it
- menu items use standard icons for common commands when available
- on iOS/iPadOS 26+, if the interaction is a menu or command list, prefer a native `UIButton` + `UIMenu` route before custom glass animation
- icon menu triggers can use `glassButtonConfiguration`; title/picker triggers can use `plainButtonConfiguration` plus a custom title/chevron layout

Behavior:

- menu reveals from the trigger, not from an unrelated edge
- native UIKit menus should use `UIButton.menu` and `UIControl.showsMenuAsPrimaryAction`; let the system own the bubble-to-menu Liquid Glass transition
- destructive actions need separation and semantic styling
- top menu actions should match swipe/contextual actions where applicable

Avoid:

- bottom sheets for every menu on desktop/tablet
- menu blur so strong that item text loses contrast
- decorative icons on every menu item
- custom spring/scale/blur timelines that imitate a system menu when a native menu can represent the same hierarchy

### 10. Sheet and inspector controls

Use for task-focused panels, side inspectors, and modal controls.

Structure:

- sheet background can be glass/material, but inner controls should not all be glass
- keep controls away from rounder sheet corners
- inspector controls should align to the content they affect

Behavior:

- half sheet can be more translucent; full sheet should become more opaque for task focus
- inspector opening should preserve detail context
- content behind the panel can peek through only when it aids orientation

Avoid:

- placing important text behind a translucent sheet edge
- nested glass inside glass inside glass
- custom background effects that fight platform sheets/popovers

## Interaction and motion mapping

| Control | Primary motion | Duration | Reduced motion |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Button | press compress / highlight | 50-100ms | color/fill state only |
| Icon button | small lift or press | 80-140ms | instant state change |
| Segmented control | thumb glide | 150-250ms | crossfade selected fill |
| Toggle | thumb glide | 150-220ms | instant thumb position |
| Slider | direct thumb tracking | direct | direct, no extra effects |
| Toolbar cluster | material drift on scroll threshold | 150-300ms | opacity/fill swap |
| Badge group | merge/split morph | 250-450ms | fade/instant regroup |
| Popover/menu | anchor reveal | 150-250ms | dissolve |
| Sheet/inspector | edge reveal / opacity | 200-350ms | dissolve or instant |

See `../../web/apple-style-motion-templates.md` for detailed templates: Press feedback, Segmented pill glide, Search field expansion, Menu cascade, Edge sheet, Glass materialize, Glass merge/split, Toolbar glass drift, and iPadOS sidebar adapt.

## Accessibility and fallback requirements

- Contrast: text and icons meet normal contrast over the final composited surface, not just against the nominal fill.
- Reduced transparency: swap blur/translucency for an opaque semantic background.
- Reduced motion: remove morph, parallax, large sliding, scroll-linked stretch, and shimmer.
- Increased contrast: increase fill opacity, border contrast, and focus ring strength.
- Keyboard: every interactive glass control has logical focus order and visible focus ring.
- Screen reader: icon-only controls need labels; selected/expanded/pressed states need semantic state.
- Pointer/touch: target sizes follow platform expectations; hover-only affordances need touch equivalents.
- Performance: avoid animating blur; animate transform/opacity or switch classes at thresholds.

## Implementation starter CSS

This is a platform-neutral starting point for Web prototypes. Tune per brand, background, and accessibility requirements.

```css
.lg-control {
  --lg-fill: rgba(255, 255, 255, .62);
  --lg-stroke: rgba(255, 255, 255, .44);
  --lg-shadow: 0 18px 48px rgba(0, 0, 0, .18);
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: .45rem;
  min-height: 44px;
  padding: 0 16px;
  color: var(--color-text, #1d1d1f);
  background: var(--lg-fill);
  border: 1px solid var(--lg-stroke);
  border-radius: 999px;
  box-shadow: var(--lg-shadow);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(18px) saturate(1.4);
  backdrop-filter: blur(18px) saturate(1.4);
  transition: transform 120ms ease, box-shadow 160ms ease, background-color 160ms ease;
}

.lg-control:hover {
  transform: translateY(-1px);
}

.lg-control:active {
  transform: scale(.985);
  box-shadow: 0 10px 28px rgba(0, 0, 0, .14);
}

.lg-control:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid var(--color-link, #0071e3);
  outline-offset: 3px;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce) {
  .lg-control {
    background: var(--color-bg-elevated, #fff);
    -webkit-backdrop-filter: none;
    backdrop-filter: none;
  }
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .lg-control {
    transition: none;
  }
  .lg-control:hover,
  .lg-control:active {
    transform: none;
  }
}
```

## QA checklist

- [ ] Does every glass control have a functional reason to be glass?
- [ ] Are related toolbar actions grouped and unrelated actions separated?
- [ ] Does the control remain readable over the busiest expected background?
- [ ] Does reduced transparency produce a deliberate opaque version?
- [ ] Does reduced motion remove morphing and scroll-linked movement?
- [ ] Are icon-only controls labeled for assistive tech?
- [ ] Are selected, disabled, loading, and error states distinguishable without color alone?
- [ ] For iOS/iPadOS 26+ menu triggers, did you use native `UIButton` + `UIMenu` before building a custom glass menu?
- [ ] For iOS/iPadOS 26+ tab navigation, did you use `UITabBar`/`UITabBarItem` instead of custom `UIGlassEffect` buttons?
- [ ] For iOS/iPadOS 26+ local mode selection, did you use `UISegmentedControl` before custom animated segment glass?
- [ ] Is `UIGlassEffect` reserved for custom glass containers such as search/refresh/input surfaces?
- [ ] Are touch targets, focus rings, and keyboard order correct?
- [ ] Is the blur layer static or threshold-based rather than continuously animated?
